# Cache

**Terai**'s internal cache is a key component of the framework, designed to
improve the efficiency of the translation process. Here are some core concepts
related to the internal cache:

- **Location**: The internal cache is stored locally in a directory named
  `.terai` within your project's root folder. The cache directory is named
  `.terai/cache`, and it's the storage location for all cached translation data.

- **Message-Based**: **Terai**'s internal cache is message-based, which means it
  stores translations on a per-message basis. Each message, which can be a
  string or key, is associated with its corresponding translated value. This
  design allows **Terai** to be efficient in managing translations.

## Usage

Whenever you run the `translate` script in **Terai** to generate translations,
the framework checks the internal cache first. **Terai** will only translate
messages that have not been historically translated before. This approach
significantly reduces the translation workload, making the process faster and
more efficient.

### Overriding Cached Values

One notable feature of the internal cache is its ability to adapt to changes in
your project's translations. If you override the values of some messages in your
locale files, the internal cache will automatically update and use the
overridden values moving forward. This ensures that the cached translations
remain in sync with the actual translations in your project.

### Manual Message Creation and Cache

In cases where you manually create a message translation, **Terai** will store
this translation in the internal cache as well. This feature allows you to add
custom translations and ensures that **Terai** leverages the cached data
effectively.

By understanding and utilizing **Terai**'s internal cache, you can streamline
your localization process and make your JavaScript applications more efficient
and responsive to changes. The internal cache is a powerful tool for developers
looking to enhance their translation workflows.
