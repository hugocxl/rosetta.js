# `ts`

**Terai** follows a source-based translation approach, which means it uses the
messages in your project as the source of truth for your translation system.
This unique approach offers several advantages that significantly enhance the
efficiency of your translation workflow.

- **Readable Files:** Your source messages are stored in a human-readable
  format. This means that finding or making changes to your locale system
  messages is a breeze. Developers can easily understand and work with the
  source messages, making the localization process faster and more efficient.
- **Automatic Updates:** When you make changes to any of the source messages,
  terai automatically generates the corresponding updates in your locale system.
  This automation streamlines the process and simplifies maintenance. You no
  longer need to manually synchronize source and localized messages, which is
  especially valuable as your project scales.
- **Variable Injection:** One of the most powerful features of the source-based
  approach is the ability to inject runtime variables directly into your
  messages. This dynamic capability allows for a wide range of improvements,
  such as static analysis and type-checking, ensuring that your translations are
  not only efficient but also error-free.

# `ts` function

The core API that you will be using most when using terai, is the `ts` function.

The `ts` function based in **tagged templates**, a more advanced form of
template literals in Javascript.
