# Extraction

Keeping your localization system up to date can be a challenging task, especially in large or fast-paced projects. It often involves duplicating work and leaves room for potential errors.

Terai's extraction feature simplifies the process of identifying all the strings that require localization in your project, making them ready for translation.

## Running the `extract` command

To extract strings for localization in your project using Terai, follow these steps:

1. Run the `terai extract` command in your project.
2. Terai will analyze the inputs to your project and search for all instances of `ts` files.
3. Each occurrence of a string will be converted into a unique hash (e.g., 78awdk123) based on its content.
4. The extracted strings will be written to a manifest file (`.terai/locale-manifest.json`).
5. Additionally, the dictionary for your `projectLocale` will be created or updated, as it does not require translation.
