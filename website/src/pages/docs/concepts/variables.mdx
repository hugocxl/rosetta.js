# Variables

Variables represent a piece of the message that is dynamic, and therefore, should be replaced with a value at runtime. In Terai, you can use the `${variable}` syntax to define variables in your translations.
Handling variables is often one of the most challenging aspects when working with translation libraries. Terai takes a specific stance on this by not natively supporting variable-related functionalities such as gender and pluralization.

  We believe that most projects can be localized without the complexity of
  dynamic variable support. If your project heavily depends on native support
  for these use cases, there are several excellent libraries available that
  excel in this area.

A variable is not translated, though you could use an already translated message.

## Basic Usage

### String Interpolation

The most common use case for variables is string interpolation. This is the process of replacing placeholders in a string with actual values. Here's an example:

```tsx copy
import { useTs } from '@terai/react'

export function Example() {
  const { ts } = useTs()
  const name = 'world'

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{ts`Hello, ${name}!`}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Composition

To compose multiple translations together, you can use variables to nest them within each other. Each ts call represents an atomic message that should be translated independently.

Here's an example:

```tsx copy
import { useTs } from '@terai/react'

type MailBoxProps = {
  name: string
  messages: string[]
}

export function MailBox({ name, messages }) {
  const { ts } = useTs()
  const inboxMsg = getInboxMsg()

  function getInboxMsg() {
    if (!messages.length) return ts`your inbox is empty`
    if (messages.length === 1) return ts`you got one message in your inbox`
    return ts`you got ${messages} messages in your inbox`
  }

  // Expected output:
  // "Hello John, your inbox is empty" || "Hello John, you got 10 messages in your inbox"

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{ts`Hello ${name}, ${inboxMsg}`}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Using composition in your messages opens the door for developers to create complex messages that can suit most use cases.
