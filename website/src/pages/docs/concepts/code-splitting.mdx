# Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique that allows developers to split their application
code into smaller, more manageable pieces. It's commonly used to enhance the
performance of web applications by loading only the necessary code when it's
needed. **Terai** takes a similar approach to code splitting for translation
messages.

The code splitting strategies in **Terai** offer several key benefits:

- **Efficient Loading:** By splitting translation messages, **Terai** ensures
  that users benefit from efficient loading. They only load the translation
  messages that are necessary for the specific part of the application they are
  using. This significantly reduces the initial load time and makes the
  application more responsive.
- **Reduced Network Traffic:** With code splitting, your application sends fewer
  translation messages over the network, leading to reduced data transfer. This
  can be especially important for users on slower or limited network
  connections.
- **Improved User Experience:** By loading only the necessary translations, you
  provide users with a better experience. They don't have to wait for
  unnecessary translations to load, and the application remains responsive and
  snappy.

## Usage

When creating an instance of `getTs` (or using `useTs` in React), you have the
option to designate the specific chunk to which the messages associated with
that instance are linked.

```tsx
import { useTs } from './locale'

export function Button() {
  const { ts } = useTs({ chunkId: 'button' })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{ts`This message will be part of the "button" chunk`}</p>
      <p>{ts`This message also will be part of the "button" chunk`}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You have the flexibility to utilize chunk IDs throughout your entire
application, simplifying the process of defining chunks according to your
specific requirements.

```tsx
import { useTs } from './locale'

export function Header() {
  const { ts } = useTs({ chunkId: 'common' })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{ts`A message in the header`}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx
import { useTs } from './locale'

export function Footer() {
  const { ts } = useTs({ chunkId: 'common' })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{ts`A message in the footer`}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

That‚Äôs it. **Terai** ensures that only the translation messages relevant to that
instance are loaded, automatically loading the required code chunk for the file.
This means you don't have to manually manage code splitting for individual
translation message files.

## Known limitations

The current static extraction process in Terai **does not involve code
execution**, which means it cannot utilize dynamic values that have not been
explicitly declared within the `getTs` or `useTs` instances.

```tsx
// ‚ùå This won't work
const CHUNK_ID = 'common'
const ts = getTs({ chunkId: CHUNK_ID })

// ‚ùå This won't work
const tsOptions = { chunkId: 'common' }
const ts = useTs(tsOptions)

// ‚úÖ This works
const ts = getTs({ chunkId: 'common' })
```
