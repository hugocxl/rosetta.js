# Getting started

Welcome to the **Terai** documentation!

## What is Terai?

**Terai**Â is a developer-first open-source localization framework for
JavaScript.

**Terai** empowers you to focus on the content of your messages, while the
framework takes care of the rest. It's a modern take on localization designed
with developers in mind, offering efficient and hassle-free translation
management.

## Workflow

The development workflow using Terai consists of simple 3 steps. This
well-defined workflow makes the localization process efficient and
straightforward.

<Steps>

### Development

Start by incorporating your translation source messages into your project using
our dedicated SDK. Explore our comprehensive guides for specific
[frameworks](/docs/overview/getting-started#framework-guides) to get started.

### Extraction

**Terai** streamlines the extraction process by automatically gathering all the
messages within your project.

### Translation

Once the messages are extracted, proceed to translate them into your desired
locales using the translator you've defined.
