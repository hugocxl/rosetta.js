# Getting started

Welcome to the **Terai** documentation!

## What is Terai?

**Terai**Â is a developer-first open-source i18n framework for
Typescript/Javascript applications.

**Terai** empowers you to focus on the content of your messages, while the
framework takes care of the rest. It's a modern take on localization designed
with developers in mind, offering efficient and hassle-free translation
management.

## Workflow

The development workflow using Terai consists of simple 3 steps. This
well-defined workflow makes the localization process efficient and
straightforward.

<Steps>

### Development

Start by incorporating your translation source messages into your project using our dedicated SDK. Explore our comprehensive guides for specific [frameworks](/docs/overview/getting-started#framework-guides) to get started.

### Extraction

**Terai** streamlines the extraction process by automatically gathering all the
messages within your project.

### Translation

Once the messages are extracted, proceed to translate them into your desired
locales using the translator you've defined.

## API

**Terai** uses your messages in your project as the source of truth for your translation system.
This unique approach offers several advantages that significantly enhance the
efficiency of your translation workflow.

- **Readable Files:** Your source messages are stored in a human-readable
  format. This means that finding or making changes to your locale system
  messages is a breeze. Developers can easily understand and work with the
  source messages, making the localization process faster and more efficient.
- **Automatic Updates:** When you make changes to any of the source messages,
  Terai automatically generates the corresponding updates in your locale system.
  This automation streamlines the process and simplifies maintenance. You no
  longer need to manually synchronize source and localized messages, which is
  especially valuable as your project scales.
- **Variable Injection:** One of the most powerful features of the source-based
  approach is the ability to inject runtime variables directly into your
  messages. This dynamic capability allows for a wide range of improvements,
  such as static analysis and type-checking, ensuring that your translations are
  not only efficient but also error-free.
