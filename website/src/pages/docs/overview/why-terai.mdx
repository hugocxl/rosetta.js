# Why Terai?

From the endless list of localization libraries, why should you choose
**Terai**?

## Backstory

The dynamic changes in the web landscape throughout the last decade have
revolutionized our approach to building and delivering software. Despite this
progress, localization has not kept pace. Conventional localization methods
often seem outdated, not in sync with the agility and innovation evident in
other facets of software development.

But it doesn't have to be this way. We're here to change that.

## A New Approach to Localization

In 2023, we embarked on a journey to modernize localization. Our mission was
born out of frustration with the complexities of managing translation systems
for our own projects. We understood that there had to be a better way, and
that's how **Terai** was born.
