      <h2>{ts`Backstory`}</h2>

      <p>
        {ts`The world of business and technology is rapidly expanding, with global growth as a common objective for many projects.\n
        However, language barriers can be a significant roadblock to entering new markets.
        While English dominates the internet, it caters to only a quarter of the world's internet users.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        {ts`To truly win the trust of consumers in these diverse markets,
      products and services must not only "speak" their language but also provide a local look and feel.
      This goes beyond mere translation; it involves a comprehensive localization process
      that takes into account local expectations, currencies, legal requirements, and more.`}
      </p>

      <p>{ts`For companies with genuine global aspirations, embracing professional localization services powered by modern technology is not just an option; it's a necessity.`}</p>

      <h2>{ts`The Stagnation of Localization`}</h2>
